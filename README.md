# 👔 Stitch Masters – Final-Term Project

This group project is a final-term submission by [@Muhammad Ahmad Amin](https://github.com/MAhmadAmin), [@Qasim Hamid](https://github.com/MuhammadQasimHamid), and [@Umar Rana](https://github.com/UmarRana2005) for the **Database Systems** course, instructed by **Prof. Nazeef ul Haq** at **UET Lahore**.



## 📘 Description

**Stitch Masters** is a web-based tailoring management system that connects customers, tailors, and fabric sellers on a single platform. It enables:

- Customers to browse fabrics, place stitching orders, and track progress  
- Tailors to manage orders, update status, and interact with clients  
- Efficient handling of measurements, deadlines, and payments  

The system uses a **normalized relational database** to ensure smooth and reliable operations across modules.

- Customers to find and work with tailors
