## Description

**Stitch Masters** is a web-based tailoring management system that connects customers, tailors, and fabric sellers on a single platform. It enables:

- Customers to browse fabrics, place stitching orders, and track progress  
- Tailors to manage orders, update status, and interact with clients  
- Efficient handling of measurements, deadlines, and payments  

The system uses a **normalized relational database** to ensure smooth and reliable operations across modules.
