# Stitch Masters – Final-Term Project

This group project is a final-term **Business Application** submission by [@Muhammad Ahmad Amin](https://github.com/MAhmadAmin), [@Qasim Hamid](https://github.com/MuhammadQasimHamid), and [@Umar Rana](https://github.com/UmarRana2005) for the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Database Systems (DB)** course, instructed by **Prof. Nazeef ul Haq** and **Prof. Dr. Awais Hassan** respectively at **UET (University of Engineering & Technology) Lahore**.

The backend of this project is a practical implementation of pure OOP concepts, combined with a well-structured relational database — reflecting all key concepts learned throughout both courses.


## Learning Objectives

- Apply pure OOP concepts like the **four pillars OOP**, **Design Patterns** & **SOLID Principles** in a real system  
- Design and implement a **normalized relational database** using MySQL 
- Understand how **backend logic and database structure** work together in a business application  
- Bridge academic learning with practical application through a complete working project  



## Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Web  
- **Framework:** Blazor  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** C# (Pure OOP)  
- **Database:** MySQL  




## Application Overview

**Stitch Masters** is a web-based tailoring management system that connects customers, tailors, and fabric sellers on a single platform. It enables:

- Customers to browse fabrics, place stitching orders, and track progress  
- Tailors to manage orders, update status, and interact with clients  
- Efficient handling of measurements, deadlines, and payments  

The system uses a **normalized relational database** to ensure smooth and reliable operations across modules.


## Motivation

Tailoring is often offline and unorganized. This platform brings the industry online—making it easier for:

- Customers to find and work with tailors  
- Tailors to grow and manage their business digitally  
- Students to apply database concepts to real-world problems  



## Business Potential

With rising demand for online custom tailoring, **Stitch Masters** can evolve into a scalable platform where:

- Tailor's list of services  
- Customers order personalized stitching  
- Fabric vendors promote their stock  



## Features

- Customer Registration & Login  
- Online Fabric Store Integration  
- Place & Track Stitching Orders  
- Upload Measurements  
- Tailor Availability Management  
- Rating & Review System  
- Secure Payments
